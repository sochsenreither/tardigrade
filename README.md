# UPGRADE consensus algorithm

## Summary

This is a work in progress implementation of the UPGRADE atomic broadcast protocol. The research and protocols for this implementation are explained in "[TARDIGRADE: An Atomic Broadcast Protocol for
Arbitrary Network Conditions](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/142.pdf)" by Erica Blum, Jonathan Katz, and Julian Loss, 2021.

The building blocks are following sub-protocols.

### Reliable Broadcast
A committee-based reliable broadcast protocol based on [Bracha's Broadcast](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82523202.pdf)

### Block Agreement
A block-agreement protocol for synchronous consensus.

### Asynchronous Common Subset
A committee-based terminating ACS protocol.

### Binary Agreement
An asynchronous byzantine agreement protocol based on [Most√©faoui et al](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00944019v2/document). Ported from [Honey Badger BFT](https://github.com/initc3/HoneyBadgerBFT-Python/)

### UPGRADE
The top level protocol that combines all the above sub-protocols into a complete consensus protocol.
